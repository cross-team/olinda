              (305) 914-8301
            </p>
            <p>Please include the following information in your correspondence: (a) the identity of the allegedly infringed work, and of the allegedly infringing work; (b) your name, address, daytime phone number, and email address, if available; (c) a statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the copyrighted work is not authorized by the owner, his or her agent, or the law; (d) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner; and (e) your electronic or physical signature.  It is Safrapay’s policy, in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers or are repeatedly charged with infringement.</p>
            <p><strong>FORCE MAJEURE</strong>.  Neither party will be responsible for performance of its obligations hereunder where delayed or hindered by events beyond their respective reasonable control, including, without limitation, any acts of God or any governmental body (including regulation, enforcement, controls or restrictions on securities trading, the Site or the Service), natural disaster, war or national emergency, riots or insurrection, sabotage, embargo, fire, flood, epidemic, pandemic, contagion, accident, strike or other labor disturbance, or interruption of or delay in systems, power or telecommunications under third-party control.</p>
            <p><strong>ARBITRATION</strong>.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement and except for actions for equitable relief, all disputes between the parties will be decided by arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect at the time of the claim or dispute and in accordance with Title 9 of the United States Code.  Notice of the demand for arbitration must be filed in writing with the other party and must be made within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen.  If the amount claimed to be in dispute is equal to or greater than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), then the arbitration will be decided by a panel of three (3) arbitrators selected under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.  If the amount claimed to be in dispute is less than that amount, then the arbitration will be decided by one (1) arbitrator selected pursuant to the same rules.  Arbitration will be initiated in New York, New York.  The arbitration will occur within sixty (60) calendar days after the party demanding arbitration delivers the written demand on the other party, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.  The arbitrators will award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrators, all of its Costs and Fees.  “Costs and Fees” mean all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators’ fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, and out-of-pocket expenses, such as copying, telephone, court costs, witness fees and attorneys’ fees.  The award rendered by the arbitrators will be final and specifically enforceable under applicable laws, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  No arbitration arising out of or relating to this Agreement may include, by consolidation, joinder or in any other manner, any person or entity not a party to this Agreement.  Neither party will appeal the award nor seek review, modification, or vacation of the award in any court or regulatory agency.  Each party shall continue to perform its respective obligations during the pendency of any dispute until such time as the dispute is resolved.  The foregoing will not prevent a party from instituting formal proceedings earlier to (i) preserve a superior position with respect to other creditors, or (ii) address a claim arising out of the breach of the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement or either party’s IPR under this Agreement.  In addition, either party may resort to court action for injunctive relief at any time if the dispute resolution process set forth in this section may permit or cause irreparable injury to such party or any third party claiming against such party, due to delay arising out of the dispute resolution process.  Any such legal action or proceeding shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in New York and you hereby accept, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of such courts. </p>
            <p><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong>.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED TO AN ARBITRATION INVOLVING ANY OTHER PARTY SUBJECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER THROUGH CLASS ACTION ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE.  ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SAFRAPAY SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION. </p>
            <p><strong>GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE</strong>.  The interpretation of the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement, including, to the extent applicable, any negotiations, arbitrations or other proceedings hereunder, will be governed in all respects exclusively by the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A. as such laws apply to contracts between New York residents performed entirely within New York without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.  Except as provided in the Arbitration section of this Agreement, each party hereto:  (a) consents to and waives any objections to personal jurisdiction, service of process, and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York, NY, U.S.A., and (b) agrees that any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be filed and prosecuted only in such courts.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTICES</strong>.  Safrapay may provide you with any notices required or allowed under this Agreement by sending you an email to any email address you provide to Safrapay in connection with your use of the Site, or by providing such notice by posting on Site.  Notices provided to Safrapay will be deemed given when actually received by Safrapay, and Safrapay will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to act on such notice.  Notice provided to you will be deemed given upon posting to Site or sending via e-mail, unless otherwise required by law prohibited or (as to e-mail) the sending party is notified that the e-mail address is invalid. </p>
            <p><strong>INTERPRETATION</strong>.  Terms used in this Agreement have the definitions given in this Agreement or, if not defined in this Agreement, have their plain English meaning as commonly interpreted in the United States.  To the extent any translated version of this Agreement conflicts with the English language version, the English language version will control.  When interpreting this Agreement: (a) any headings are for reference purposes only and shall not be used in the construction and interpretation of this Agreement; (b) the singular includes the plural, and vice versa; (c) “includes”, “including”, “for example”, “such as” and similar terms are not words of limitation; (d) no rule of construction applies to the disadvantage of a party because that party was responsible for the preparation of this Agreement; (e) “law” means any foreign, federal, state or local law (including common law), statute, standard, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, promulgation or any order by any governmental authority; and (f) “governmental authority” means any government or governmental or regulatory body thereof, or political subdivision thereof, whether federal, state, local or foreign, or any agency, instrumentality or authority thereof, or any court or arbitrator (public or private).</p>
            <p><strong>ADDITIONAL TERMS</strong>.  This Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement between you and Safrapay regarding your access to and use of the Site.  This Agreement supersedes any prior agreement or proposal, oral or written, and any other communications between you and Safrapay relating to your use of the Site.  Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended or modified only by a writing signed by both parties.  All waivers by Safrapay under this Agreement must be in writing or later acknowledged by Safrapay in writing.  Any waiver or failure by Safrapay to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver by Safrapay of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, that provision shall be removed to the extent necessary to comply with the law, replaced by a provision that most closely approximates the original intent and economic effect of the original to the extent consistent with the law, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force.  The prevailing party in any lawsuit or proceeding arising from or related to this Agreement shall be entitled to receive its costs, expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys’ fees, including costs and fees on appeal.  You may not assign or transfer either this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations hereunder (in whole or in part and including by sale, merger, consolidation, gift, or other operation of law) without the prior written approval of Safrapay.  Any assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void.  Safrapay may assign this Agreement to any party that assumes Safrapay’s obligations hereunder.  The parties hereto are independent contractors, not agents, employees or employers of the other or joint venturers, and neither acquires hereunder any right or ability to bind or enter into any obligation on behalf of the other.  You should not interpret any Content provided by Safrapay as tax, legal, financial, or investment advice.  We have no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to you and your use of the Site does not create such a relationship.  You agree and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for conducting legal, accounting and other due diligence review on the information posted on the Site.</p>
